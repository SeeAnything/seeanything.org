                Start with a black image and increment each pixel until the image
                becomes white. Then you will have created every image possible within
                that frame.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every day, images are generated this way using billions of iterations,
                with the most recent image on display at SeeAnything.org. The frame
                holding the image is 320 pixels by 240 pixels for a total of 76,800 pixels.
                Each pixel is monochromatic, represented by 256 values of grey. That is to
                say that each pixel takes 256 times longer to reach white than the pixel
                before it.

                To express all possible images this way will take years. To archive all of
                these images would require Yottabytes of digital storage. These images, however,
                are not stored. The image on the home page is the most recently generated image
                and is replaced by an even newer image every time one becomes available.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the thousands of images created each day, there is the potential to
                see anything. These images could be pictures of any historic moment,
                anything happening in the world at this very moment, or something that hasn't
                yet happened. Of course, it's more likely that you will see something
                that will never happen.

                But mostly, these images are nonsense.
